There are exactly two types of contacts; persons and companies. They both have an address and a name so an abstract parent class "Contact" should provide universal methods to perform operations on these attributes.
A person doesn't have any distinguishing attributes or methods in this current version and just provides a person specific constructor.
A company also has an owner (a Person object or another Company object) and therefore provides getters and setters for this attribute in addition to the company specific constructors.
Any contact needs a name (a first name in the case of a person). All other attributes are optional as a user might not have all the required information or might not want to enter it.

The code was originally written in Neovim (Linux) and Visual Studio Code (Windows) and tested using jdk-11.0.16.101.
./src/main.java contains a main method with a built-in manual and instructions on how to use the application.
